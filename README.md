# Awesome-Multimodal-Large-Language-Model-Unlearning
A resource repository for machine unlearning in multimodal large language models
This repository tracks the latest research on machine unlearning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The goal is to offer a comprehensive list of papers and resources relevant to the topic.

> [!NOTE]
> If you believe your paper on MLLM unlearning is not included, or if you find a mistake, typo, or information that is not up to date, please open an issue or submit a pull request, and I will be happy to update the list.
